  "text": "AI H1: Salesforce Quarterly Highlights: FY26 Q2 Product Releases and Corporate Announcements Salesforce is leading the digital labor revolution, bringing together apps, data, and agents into one deeply unified platform to drive bottom-line growth for customers. Over the past quarter, a wave of cutting-edge innovations across Agentforce , Data Cloud , Tableau , and Slack have made the platform even more powerful, making it easier for customers to deploy digital labor and realize tangible business value. Those breakthroughs include Agentforce 3, industry-specific AI agents, deeper integration of AI and CRM throughout Slack, and expanded flexible pricing options. Salesforce also deployed Agentforce across its business to gain firsthand insights to refine the platform, and strengthened the company’s AI ecosystem through key investments and acquisitions — ‌all while driving success for customers of every size and industry. Those breakthroughs include Agentforce 3, industry-specific AI agents, deeper integration of AI and CRM throughout Slack, and expanded flexible pricing options. H2: Product Updates Salesforce channels : This is a new type of Slack channel that turns CRM records into real-time, AI-powered conversations. These channels are bi-directional and fully accessible in both Salesforce and Slack, giving teams one connected space to break down silos, collaborate, and take action. Salesforce channels also keep both human and agent teammates in sync thanks to built-in access to Agentforce, helping ensure conversations, context, and data always stay connected. GA now Tableau Next : This new integration, now available in Slack, allows users to share AI-powered metrics, dashboards, and visualizations across channels, messages, and canvases — keeping insights and related discussions in one place. This integration makes Slack the core operating system for enterprise work inside Salesforce, connecting people, data, and actions for faster results. GA now Marketing Cloud Next : This full-funnel agentic marketing solution turns every channel into a two-way conversation, helping teams move faster, engage at scale, and drive better results. AI agents can autonomously handle campaign creation, performance optimization, and 1:1 personalization — freeing marketers to focus more time on strategy, creativity, and building lasting customer relationships. And because Marketing Cloud Next is built on the Salesforce Platform , these AI agents aren’t limited to marketing — they operate across Sales , Service , and Commerce , orchestrating 1:1 customer engagement across the full funnel. GA now Agentforce 3 : This major upgrade to the digital labor platform helps companies monitor, improve, and scale their AI workforce with clarity, control, and speed. The new Agentforce Command Center provides a complete observability solution that enables leaders to monitor agent health, measure performance, and optimize outcomes. Agentforce 3 empowers seamless agent interoperability with built-in support for open standards like Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent2Agent (A2A). For plug-and-play interoperability, the expanded AgentExchange offers MCP servers from over 30 partners – including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, IBM, and more. Agentforce 3 also offers an enhanced Atlas architecture, providing an enterprise-ready foundation through lower latency, greater accuracy, enhanced resiliency, and support for natively hosted LLMs such as Anthropic. GA now MuleSoft AI : These new capabilities help organizations build a foundation for secure, scalable AI agent orchestration. These capabilities deliver essential support for agent protocols like MCP and A2A by allowing customers to make any existing integration, API, and application accessible and understandable by AI agents and build multi-agent workflows with robust governance. Using new generative AI tools, developers can build APIs and integrations faster with natural language prompts and deploy those capabilities in any AI-first Integrated Developer Environment. GA now Agentforce for Net Zero : This new integration helps sustainability teams streamline reporting, reduce operational costs, and boost efficiency through pre-built agent topics and actions. Agentforce for Net Zero introduces two new capabilities: Insights Gathering, which helps customers access precise, real-time sustainability data and insights via natural language, and Disclosure Assistance, which automates responses for major reporting frameworks by drawing from Net Zero Cloud’s Information Library and other saved documents. GA now Agentforce for Revenue : Embedded into Revenue Cloud, this solution streamlines the entire quote-to-cash process with greater speed, accuracy, and confidence. Sellers simply describe what they need — like “Quote 25 licenses with a 10% discount” — and Agentforce instantly generates the quote. Teams quickly tailor complex offerings with Revenue Cloud’s enhanced Product Configurator, which supports quotes exceeding a thousand lines and augments traditional configuration with a new guided constraint builder. GA now New AI and search capabilities in Slack : New Slack features help teams move faster, stay aligned, and focus on what matters most. With enterprise search, you can ask questions in the Slack search bar and instantly get answers from your organization’s connected applications — helping make quicker, more informed decisions, without leaving Slack. New connectors include Microsoft Teams and Confluence Cloud. Soon, AI writing assistance, AI huddle notes, AI profile summaries, and AI-generated action items will be available — capturing key points and next steps so teams can stay focused and aligned. Enterprise Search connectors GA now Updated Slack plans and pricing : This latest change enables customers to benefit from native AI, access to digital labor, deeper CRM integrations, and enterprise-grade security so they can scale faster. AI features, Agentforce, and enhanced security controls are now included in all paid plans. Additionally, all Salesforce customers now have access to Slack’s free plan, so every team can collaborate around CRM data with Salesforce Channels in Slack or from Salesforce. GA now Expanded Agentforce payment options : Earlier this month, Salesforce introduced three distinct ways to pay for Agentforce usage to give every customer the freedom to choose the billing model that best fits their needs. With pay-as-you-go pricing, customers can get started with Agentforce with no upfront commitment and pay monthly for Flex Credits used. A pre-commit option allows customers to unlock more favorable pricing by making an upfront payment. The existing pre-purchase option allows customers to pay upfront for a set amount of usage over their contract term and draw from that balance as they go. This unlocks the best overall rate, and is ideal for businesses with predictable, consistent usage. GA now Agentforce for Pu blic Sector : Agentforce enables government agencies to build, tailor, and deploy custom and out-of-the-box AI agents to autonomously handle work like answering citizen queries and processing license renewals. With this solution, agencies can quickly deploy prebuilt actions specifically designed for the public sector, such as ‘check for regulatory code violations’ — saving development time, increasing efficiency, and improving productivity for government workers. Agentforce adheres to stringent global compliance requirements, including FedRAMP High , Protected-B, and IRAP, so government leaders can trust their agents are secure and compliant. GA now Agentforce for Manufacturing : Agentforce helps manufacturers deploy out-of-the-box AI agents to optimize operations, support sales terms, reduce asset downtime, and enhance customer service. With Agentforce for Manufacturing, AI agents can be quickly deployed and adapted for every employee, department, and organizational process — saving development time, increasing efficiency, and improving productivity for manufacturing workers. Agentforce for Manufacturing is rooted in industry-specific data models, apps, and processes to deliver contextual, accurate answers. GA now H2: Customer Zero Momentum 1 Million Support Requests on Salesforce Help : In July, Salesforce announced that Agentforce had handled over 1 million support requests on its own Help site since launching in October of 2024, resolving more than 84% of questions autonomously. Agentforce on Help has significantly reduced costly human escalations and improved response time, and is projected to achieve $50 million in annual cost savings by the end of the fiscal year. Internal Agentforce Use Cases: Salesforce also uses agents to nurture sales leads at scale, deliver tailored training and career recommendations for employees, increase developer productivity , and more — all while continuously capturing learnings to improve agent performance and user experience.
