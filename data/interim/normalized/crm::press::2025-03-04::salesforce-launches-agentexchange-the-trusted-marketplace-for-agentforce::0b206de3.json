Building on the success of Salesforce AppExchange — the first and world’s largest enterprise cloud marketplace, which has grown to more than 13 million app installs — AgentExchange expands the capabilities and ecosystem of Agentforce, Salesforce’s digital labor platform. AgentExchange launches with more than 200 initial partners and hundreds of ready-made actions, topics, and templates that have passed rigorous security and customer reviews.
