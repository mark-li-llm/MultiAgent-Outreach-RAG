The study also identified the factors driving adoption of AI – led by improving productivity – and the biggest barriers to adoption, including the talent gap, data governance and risk management, cost, and trustworthiness and bias. Why it matters : While previous iterations of this study focused more narrowly on how cloud solutions were driving the Salesforce ecosystem’s growth, IDC expanded its approach in the latest version to account for the effect of AI in general – and specifically the potential of generative AI – on the company’s economic footprint.

This year’s study brings into focus just how powerful AI is and how it’s transforming businesses across sales, service, marketing, commerce, and IT.

For example, Sales Cloud is helping sellers auto-generate personalized emails, based on their unique CRM data that provides relevant context to prevent hallucinations, all with just a single click, giving sellers more time to focus on customers and close deals. Service Cloud customers can now auto-generate personalized replies using real-time data to help service reps resolve customer issues faster. At the center of Salesforce’s AI innovations is trust. The Einstein Trust Layer allows customers to reap the benefits of generative AI while ensuring their enterprise data remains secure and within compliance regulations.

It estimates Salesforce’s current and future share of the benefits to the general economy generated by AI-powered cloud computing, including the size of the ecosystem supporting Salesforce using IDC’s existing market research and informed by current survey data. Advances in artificial intelligence have made an undeniable impact on global businesses so IDC’s 2023 methodology was updated to reflect the influence of AI-powered cloud computing. Moreover, the model has been improved through the application of a standard analytical framework, known as an Economic Impact Analysis, which leverages input-output (I/O) tables, using the most updated input-output official tables of a specific economy. This methodology evaluates three types of impact for economic and social variables (GDP and Jobs): Direct impact includes all direct effects in terms of jobs and revenues of the organization/tech provider. Indirect effect on supply chain and demand includes the effects that the organization/tech provider has on the region or country due to the organization’s operations. The impact is measured in terms of jobs and revenues generated and customers and providers. Induced effects: This is the effect induced from the increase in production. It refers to the impact due to economic stimulus coming from increased households’ income. People will spend their wages in the economy, thus generating additional jobs and revenues.
