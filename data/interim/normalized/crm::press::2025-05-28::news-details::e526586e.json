Results First quarter revenue of $9.8 billion, up 8% both year-over-year (\"Y/Y\") and in constant currency (\"CC\") First quarter subscription & support revenue of $9.3 billion, up 8% Y/Y and 9% in CC Current remaining performance obligation of $29.6 billion, up 12% Y/Y and 11% in CC First quarter GAAP operating margin of 19.8% and non-GAAP operating margin of 32.3% First quarter operating cash flow of $6.5 billion, up 4% Y/Y, and free cash flow of $6.3 billion, up 4% Y/Y Returned $3.1 billion to shareholders, including $2.7 billion in share repurchases and $402 million in dividends “We delivered strong Q1 results and are raising our guidance by $400 million to $41.3 billion at the high end of the range,” said Marc Benioff, Chair and CEO, Salesforce. “We’ve built a deeply unified enterprise AI platform—with agents, data, apps, and a metadata platform—that is unmatched in the industry. With Agentforce, Data Cloud, our Customer 360 apps, Tableau, and Slack all built on one trusted, unified foundation, companies of every size can build a digital labor force—boosting productivity, reducing costs, and accelerating growth. And, with our agreement to acquire Informatica, we will bring together the industry’s leading AI CRM and AI-powered MDM and ETL platform to create the most complete, intelligent AI and data platform for the enterprise.\" “I’m pleased by our momentum as we capitalize on the exciting agentic AI opportunity,” said Robin Washington, President and Chief Operating and Financial Officer, Salesforce. “Our Q1 performance reflects solid execution, driven by our continued focus on innovation, operational excellence, and maximizing value for our customers and shareholders.\" Business Highlights Data Cloud and AI annual recurring revenue over $1 billion, up more than 120% Y/Y Nearly 60% of Q1 top 100 deals included Data Cloud and AI Salesforce has closed over 8,000 deals since launching Agentforce, of which half are paid On help.salesforce.com, Agentforce has handled over 750,000 requests, cutting case volume by 7% Y/Y Data Cloud ingested 22 trillion records in Q1, up 175% Y/Y More than half of Salesforce's Q1 Top 100 Deals included 6+ Clouds Guidance Yesterday, Salesforce announced that the Company signed a definitive agreement to acquire Informatica Inc. There is no anticipated impact to Salesforce’s FY26 guidance as a result of this transaction based on the expected close timing in early FY27. With the U.S. dollar weakening in Q1, Salesforce now expects a currency tailwind for the business. This tailwind has been incorporated into the Company's updated FY26 guidance. Initiates second quarter FY26 revenue guidance of $10.11 billion to $10.16 billion, up 8% - 9% Y/Y and 7% - 8% in CC Raises full year FY26 revenue guidance to $41.0 billion to $41.3 billion, up 8% - 9% Y/Y and 8% in CC Maintains full year FY26 GAAP operating margin guidance of 21.6%, and non-GAAP operating margin guidance of 34.0% Maintains full year FY26 operating cash flow growth guidance of approximately 10% to 11% Y/Y Salesforce's guidance includes GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. The following tables summarize Salesforce's guidance for the second quarter fiscal 2026 and full-year fiscal 2026: Q2 FY26 Guidance GAAP Non-GAAP (1) Revenue $10.11 - $10.16 billion Revenue growth (2) 8% - 9% 7% - 8% CC, $100M Y/Y FX Diluted net income per share $1.80 - $1.82 $2.76 - $2.78 Current remaining performance obligation growth (3) Approximately 10% Approximately 9% CC, $300M Y/Y FX Full Year FY26 Guidance GAAP Non-GAAP (1) Revenue $41.0 - $41.3 billion Revenue growth (2) 8% - 9% Approximately 8% CC, $250M Y/Y FX Subscription & support revenue growth (4) Approximately 9.5% Approximately 9% CC Operating margin 21.6% 34.0% Diluted net income per share $7.15 - $7.21 $11.27 - $11.33 Operating cash flow growth Approximately 10% - 11% Free cash flow growth Approximately 9% - 10% (1) Non-GAAP CC revenue growth, non-GAAP CC remaining performance obligation growth, non-GAAP CC subscription & support revenue growth, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP diluted net income per share, and free cash flow growth are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's shares used in computing GAAP diluted net income per share guidance and non-GAAP diluted net income per share guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q2 - Q4 FY26 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. (2) Revenue FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period average rates. (3) Current remaining performance obligation FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period ending rates. (4) Subscription & support revenue excludes professional services revenue. The following is a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin guidance to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the full year: Full Year FY26 Guidance GAAP operating margin (1) 21.6% Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles (2) 3.7% Stock-based compensation expense (2)(3) 8.4% Restructuring (2)(3) 0.3% Non-GAAP operating margin (1) 34.0% (1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. (2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance for full year FY26. (3) The percentages shown in the restructuring line have been calculated based on charges associated with the Company's restructuring initiatives. Stock-based compensation expense excludes stock-based compensation expense related to the Company's restructuring initiatives, which is included in the restructuring line. The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted net income per share to non-GAAP diluted net income per share guidance for the next quarter and the full year: Fiscal 2026 Q2 FY26 GAAP diluted net income per share range (1)(2) $1.80 - $1.82 $7.15 - $7.21 Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles 0.39 $ 1.57 Stock-based compensation expense 0.82 $ 3.54 Restructuring (3) — $ 0.11 Less Income tax effects and adjustments (4) (0.25 ) $ (1.10 ) Non-GAAP diluted net income per share (2) $2.76 - $2.78 $11.27 - $11.33 Shares used in computing basic net income per share (millions) (5) 960 963 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions) (5) 967 971 (1) The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 22.5% for the three months ended July 31, 2025 and the year ended January 31, 2026. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. (2) The Company's projected GAAP and non-GAAP diluted net income per share assumes no change to the value of our strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. The impact of future gains or losses from the Company’s strategic investment portfolio could be material. (3) The estimated impact to GAAP diluted net income per share is in connection with the Company's restructuring initiatives. (4) The Company’s non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 22.0%, which reflects currently available information and could be subject to change. (5) The Company's shares used in computing GAAP net income per share guidance and non-GAAP net income per share guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q2 - Q4 FY26 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures see the reconciliation of results and related explanations below. Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call.

Salesforce, Inc. Additional Metrics (Unaudited) S upplemental Revenue Analysis R emaining Performance Obligation Remaining performance obligation (\"RPO\") represents contracted revenue that has not yet been recognized, which includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. RPO is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of term license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of RPO denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. The portion of RPO that is unbilled is not recorded on the condensed consolidated balance sheets. RPO consisted of the following (in billions): Current Noncurrent Total As of April 30, 2025 $ 29.6 $ 31.3 $ 60.9 As of January 31, 2025 30.2 33.2 63.4 As of October 31, 2024 26.4 26.7 53.1 As of July 31, 2024 26.5 27.0 53.5 As of April 30, 2024 26.4 27.5 53.9 Unearned Revenue Unearned revenue represents amounts that have been invoiced in advance of revenue recognition and is recognized as revenue when transfer of control to customers has occurred or services have been provided.

These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating the Company’s performance. The primary purpose of using non-GAAP financial measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in the same way management does. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the Company’s operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s business. Further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP financial measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company’s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results. Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP income from operations excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and charges associated with the Company's restructuring activities. Non-GAAP net income per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, charges related to the Company's restructuring activities and income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the Company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods. As described above, the Company excludes or adjusts for the following in its non-GAAP results and guidance: Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation expense to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and, in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although the Company excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Restructuring: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and may include employee notice period costs and severance payments, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization and other related expenses. The Company excludes these restructuring charges because they are distinct from ongoing operational costs and it does not believe they are reflective of current and expected future business performance and operating results. Gains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, net: The Company records all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses, the Company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for future periods, including its guidance. Gains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, net, are included in its GAAP financial statements. Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based compensation expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles. The projected rate also considers factors including the Company’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. For fiscal 2025, the Company used a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 22.0%. For fiscal 2026, the Company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 22.0%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how the Company's underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present constant currency revenue growth rates, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. To present current remaining performance obligation growth rates on a constant currency basis, current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in previous comparable periods are converted using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date. The Company defines Data Cloud and AI annual recurring revenue (\"ARR\") as the annualized recurring value of active Data Cloud and certain generative Artificial Intelligence (“AI”) subscription agreements, including those for Agentforce and standalone generative AI products, at the end of the reporting period. The Company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures.
