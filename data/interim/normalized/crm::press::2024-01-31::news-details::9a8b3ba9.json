We intend to pay a cash dividend on a quarterly basis going forward, subject to market conditions and approval by our Board of Directors. Forward Looking Guidance As of February 28, 2024, the Company is initiating its first quarter GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, current remaining performance obligation growth guidance, and revenue guidance. The Company is initiating its full year FY25 revenue guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance, GAAP and non-GAAP operating margin guidance, subscription and support revenue growth guidance, and operating cash flow growth guidance. Our guidance assumes no change to the value of the Company's strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. In addition, the guidance below is based on estimated GAAP tax rates that reflect the Company’s currently available information, and excludes forecasted discrete tax items such as excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. Q1 FY25 Guidance Full Year FY25 Guidance Total Revenue $9.12 - $9.17 Billion $37.7 - $38.0 Billion Y/Y Growth 11% 9% FX Impact (1) ($50M) Y/Y FX ($100M) Y/Y FX Subscription & Support Revenue Y/Y Growth (4) N/A Approx 10%, Slightly Above 10% in CC GAAP Operating Margin N/A ~20.4% Non-GAAP Operating Margin (2) N/A ~32.5% GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $1.42 - $1.44 $6.07 - $6.15 Non-GAAP Diluted Earnings per Share (2) $2.37 - $2.39 $9.68 - $9.76 Operating Cash Flow Growth (Y/Y) N/A 21% - 24% Current Remaining Performance Obligation Growth (Y/Y) 11% N/A FX Impact (3) ($200M) Y/Y FX N/A (1) Revenue FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period average rates. (2) Non-GAAP operating margin and non-GAAP Diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures. See below for an explanation of non-GAAP financial measures. The Company's shares used in computing GAAP Diluted EPS guidance and non-GAAP Diluted EPS guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential Q1 - Q4 FY25 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. (3) Current Remaining Performance Obligation FX impact is calculated by taking the current period rates compared to the prior period ending rates. (4) Subscription & Support revenue excludes professional services revenue. The following is a reconciliation of GAAP operating margin guidance to non-GAAP operating margin guidance for the full year: Full Year FY25 Guidance GAAP operating margin (1) ~20.4% Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles (2) 4.4% Stock-based compensation expense (2)(3) 7.7% Restructuring (2)(3) —% Non-GAAP operating margin (1) ~32.5% (1) GAAP operating margin is the proportion of GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP operating margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. (2) The percentages shown above have been calculated based on the midpoint of the low and high ends of the revenue guidance for full year FY25. (3) The percentages shown in the restructuring line have been calculated based on charges associated with the Company's restructuring activities. Stock-based compensation expense included in the full year FY25 guidance GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation table excludes stock-based compensation expense related to the Company's restructuring activities, which is included in the restructuring line. The following is a per share reconciliation of GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP diluted EPS guidance for the next quarter and the full year: Fiscal 2025 Q1 FY25 GAAP diluted earnings per share range (1)(2) $1.42 - $1.44 $6.07 - $6.15 Plus Amortization of purchased intangibles $ 0.47 $ 1.64 Stock-based compensation expense $ 0.73 $ 2.92 Restructuring (3) $ — $ 0.02 Less Income tax effects and adjustments (4) $ (0.25 ) $ (0.97 ) Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share (2) $2.37 - $2.39 $9.68 - $9.76 Shares used in computing basic net income per share (millions) (5) 976 986 Shares used in computing diluted net income per share (millions) (5) 994 1,002 (1) The Company's GAAP tax provision is expected to be approximately 22.5% for the three months ended April 30, 2024, and approximately 22.5% for the year ended January 31, 2025. The GAAP tax rates may fluctuate due to discrete tax items and related effects in conjunction with certain provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, future acquisitions or other transactions. (2) The Company's projected GAAP and non-GAAP diluted EPS assumes no change to the value of our strategic investment portfolio as it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses. The impact of future gains or losses from the Company’s strategic investment portfolio could be material. (3) The estimated impact to GAAP diluted EPS is in connection with the Company's restructuring activities. (4) The Company’s non-GAAP tax provision uses a long-term projected tax rate of 22.0%, which reflects currently available information and could be subject to change. (5) The Company's shares used in computing GAAP earnings per share guidance and non-GAAP earnings per share guidance excludes any impact to share count from potential FY25 repurchase activity under our share repurchase program. For additional information regarding non-GAAP financial measures see the reconciliation of results and related explanations below. Management will provide further commentary around these guidance assumptions on its earnings call.

RPO is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, the timing of software license deliveries, average contract terms and foreign currency exchange rates.

These non-GAAP financial measures are measurements of financial performance that are not prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and computational methods may differ from those used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP measures and should be read only in conjunction with the Company’s consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management uses both GAAP and non-GAAP measures when planning, monitoring and evaluating the Company’s performance. The primary purpose of using non-GAAP measures is to provide supplemental information that may prove useful to investors and to enable investors to evaluate the Company’s results in the same way management does. Management believes that supplementing GAAP disclosure with non-GAAP disclosure provides investors with a more complete view of the Company’s operational performance and allows for meaningful period-to-period comparisons and analysis of trends in the Company’s business. Further to the extent that other companies use similar methods in calculating non-GAAP measures, the provision of supplemental non-GAAP information can allow for a comparison of the Company’s relative performance against other companies that also report non-GAAP operating results. Non-GAAP Operating Margin is the proportion of non-GAAP income from operations as a percentage of GAAP revenue. Non-GAAP income from operations excludes the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, and charges related to the Restructuring Plan. Non-GAAP earnings per share excludes, to the extent applicable, the impact of the following items: stock-based compensation expense, amortization of purchased intangibles, charges related to the Restructuring Plan, and income tax adjustments. These items are excluded because the decisions that give rise to them are not made to increase revenue in a particular period, but instead for the Company’s long-term benefit over multiple periods. As described above, the Company excludes or adjusts for the following in its non-GAAP results and guidance: Stock-Based Compensation Expense: The Company’s compensation strategy includes the use of stock-based compensation expense to attract and retain employees and executives. It is principally aimed at aligning their interests with those of our stockholders and at long-term employee retention, rather than to motivate or reward operational performance for any particular period. Thus, stock-based compensation expense varies for reasons that are generally unrelated to operational decisions and performance in any particular period. Amortization of Purchased Intangibles: The Company views amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, customer lists and customer relationships, and in some cases, acquired lease intangibles, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities determined at the time of an acquisition. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangibles is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although the Company excludes the amortization of purchased intangibles from these non-GAAP measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase accounting and contribute to revenue generation. Restructuring: Restructuring charges are costs associated with a formal restructuring plan and may include employee notice period costs and severance payments, lease or contract termination costs, asset impairments, accelerated depreciation and amortization, and other related expenses. The Company excludes these restructuring charges because they are distinct from ongoing operational costs and it does not believe they are reflective of current and expected future business performance and operating results. Gains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, net: The Company records all fair value adjustments to its equity securities held within the strategic investment portfolio through the statement of operations. As it is not possible to forecast future gains and losses, the Company assumes no change to the value of its strategic investment portfolio in its GAAP and non-GAAP estimates for future periods, including its guidance. Gains (Losses) on Strategic Investments, net, are included in its GAAP financial statements. Income Tax Effects and Adjustments: The Company utilizes a fixed long-term projected non-GAAP tax rate in order to provide better consistency across the interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of items such as changes in the tax valuation allowance and tax effects of acquisition-related costs, since each of these can vary in size and frequency. When projecting this long-term rate, the Company evaluated a three-year financial projection that excludes the direct impact of the following non-cash items: stock-based expenses and the amortization of purchased intangibles. The projected rate also considers factors including the Company’s expected tax structure, its tax positions in various jurisdictions and key legislation in major jurisdictions where the Company operates. For fiscal 2024 and 2023, the Company used a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 23.5% and 22.0%, respectively. For fiscal 2025, the Company uses a projected non-GAAP tax rate of 22.0%, which reflects currently available information, as well as other factors and assumptions. The non-GAAP tax rate could be subject to change for a variety of reasons, including the rapidly evolving global tax environment, significant changes in the Company’s geographic earnings mix due to acquisition activity, or other changes to the Company’s strategy or business operations. The Company will re-evaluate its long-term rate as appropriate. The Company presents constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how the Company's underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations. To present constant currency revenue growth rates, current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than United States dollars are converted into United States dollars at the weighted average exchange rate for the quarter being compared to rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during that period. To present current remaining performance obligation growth rates on a constant currency basis, current remaining performance obligation balances in local currencies in previous comparable periods are converted using the United States dollar currency exchange rate as of the most recent balance sheet date. The Company defines the non-GAAP measure free cash flow as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities, less capital expenditures.
