  "text": "Artificial Intelligence H1: Salesforce Introduces New Flexible Agentforce Pricing to Accelerate the Digital Labor Revolution Media Library New ‘Flex Credits’ pricing model enables businesses to scale AI-powered digital labor to every employee, department, and process SAN FRANCISCO – May 15, 2025 – Salesforce (NYSE: CRM), the global leader in AI CRM, today introduced new flexible pricing for Agentforce designed to meet rapidly accelerating demand for digital labor for every employee, department, and business process. AI adoption is moving at an unprecedented pace, yet for many CIOs, the challenge lies in maintaining cost control amid the pressure to innovate. Survey data shows 90% of CIOs report that managing AI costs is limiting their ability to drive value. Organizations are increasingly seeking a pricing model aligned to how AI agents deliver business outcomes and create value. This new approach enables teams to start small, experiment flexibly with different use cases, and then scale their success across their entire enterprise, empowering humans and agents to work together seamlessly to drive success. To accelerate this shift toward limitless digital labor capacity, Salesforce today introduced three major pricing innovations explicitly designed to unlock AI adoption at scale, empower organizations to expand their digital workforces, and deliver strategic investment flexibility enterprise-wide: 1. New Flex Credits to scale Agentforce across every workflow Thousands of organizations have successfully leveraged Salesforce’s existing conversational pricing at $2 per conversation. Now, Salesforce introduces Flex Credits, offering customers unprecedented flexibility with a consumption-based model that aligns cost with business outcomes. Flex Credits ensure you only pay for the exact actions Agentforce performs‌ — ‌whether that’s updating customer records, automating complex workflows, or resolving cases. Each of these actions consumes just 20 Flex Credits ($0.10 per action), directly tying your investment to measurable, valuable AI-driven results. Flex Credits, available in packs of 100,000 credits ($500), empower companies to scale and manage AI investments effectively, driving deeper and broader business outcomes. Through the Salesforce Digital Wallet, customers can strategically allocate AI spend to align directly with high-value use cases, optimizing their AI initiatives for maximum impact. Additionally, organizations gain detailed insights into usage trends, credit consumption, demand forecasting, and can proactively manage their supply of credits as new agents launch and AI adoption expands. 2. New Flex Agreement to shift investment as priorities change Salesforce’s new Flex Agreement allows organizations to manage both human and digital labor and strategically shift their investments between user licenses or digital labor as their business priorities demand. This agreement enables customers to get the most from their budgets, converting user licenses into Flex Credits, or Flex Credits into new user licenses, for exploring new, value-generating use cases. The structure of the Flex Agreement empowers organizations to continually adapt their AI investment strategies, supporting expanded growth and revenue opportunities while increasing overall spending efficiency. 3. New Agentforce user licenses, and add-ons with included Agentforce usage Organizations today are actively leveraging Agentforce to empower their teams, driving growth and innovation across every department. Customers are successfully deploying specialized AI agents to work side-by-side with their employees‌ — ‌automating routine tasks in sales, streamlining employee onboarding in HR, rapidly surfacing IT knowledge, and proactively resolving customer service cases. Salesforce’s new Agentforce user licenses and add-ons make it easier than ever to bring these powerful capabilities to every employee, offering unmetered employee-facing agent usage in a simple per user per month (PUPM) pricing model. With AI seamlessly integrated within Salesforce and Slack, businesses can effortlessly and confidently augment their teams in every part of their business with digital labor‌ — ‌all without the concern of running into usage caps. What Industry Analysts & Customers Are Saying “Salesforce’s new flexible pricing model allows us to use AI agents for different types of use cases far beyond customer service and traditional CRM, and aligns our costs directly with the business value we achieve,” said Elia Wallen, CEO, Engine. “It’s a sign of Salesforce’s ongoing evolution from a software provider into a technology partner that’s deeply embedded with our IT organization so that we can deploy AI agents across our company and scale business results using their tools and technology.” Salesforce’s new flexible pricing model allows us to use AI agents for different types of use cases far beyond customer service and traditional CRM, and aligns our costs directly with the business value we achieve. Elia Wallen, CEO, Engine “AI implementation is a business decision as much as a technology one,” said Kirsten Rhodes, Vice Chair, Client Relationship Development Leader, Deloitte US. “Salesforce’s new approach gives organizations the ability to customize their investments to not only help achieve their goals now but the flexibility to adapt to their evolving needs in the future.”* “The shift toward a flexible consumption model is exactly what’s needed to empower organizations to adopt AI more confidently as Agentforce’s capabilities expand to new use cases far beyond conversation-based customer interactions,” said Ritu Jyoti, GVP and GM, AI and Data at IDC. “It allows businesses to align their investments more closely with the value derived from agent performance, and Salesforce has taken it a step further – giving customers flexibility not just in how they use credits but allowing them to swap between seats and credits as companies experiment with deploying ‘digital labor’ in their organizations.” “This new approach should make it much easier to do business with Salesforce – particularly as their portfolio of offerings expands with the evolution of agentic AI and their platform approach with Agentforce,” said Patrick Moorhead, CEO and Chief Analyst, Moor Insights & Strategy. “Allowing customers the flexibility to reallocate budget or swap unused licenses for credits that can be used toward new investments like Agentforce, is very powerful and unique. It’s lowering the barrier to entry for experimentation and adoption of Agentforce.” “Our research indicates that businesses are continuing to significantly invest in agentic AI to improve customer experiences as expectations around personalization and fast resolution times increase,” said Sheryl Kingstone, Distinguished Analyst, 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence. “While the majority of businesses still prefer to purchase technology using a license model, there is a rising desire for pricing that’s aligned to outcomes.”** Pricing Summary Flex Credits — Pay per action as you scale with Agentforce $500 USD per 100,000 Credits One Agentforce action consumes 20 Flex Credits ($0.10 USD) All customers with Enterprise Edition or above can get 100,000 Flex Credits for $0 with Salesforce Foundations.
