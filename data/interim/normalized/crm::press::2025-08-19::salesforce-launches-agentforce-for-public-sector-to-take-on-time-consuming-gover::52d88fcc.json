Government innovators like the City of Kyle are using Agentforce to autonomously handle diverse citizen requests, speeding up services and improving experiences for constituents. Government agencies face increasing pressure to improve responsiveness, efficiency, and productivity amid staffing shortages and rising public expectations. That’s why Salesforce today launched Agentforce for Public Sector to augment government workers with digital labor — a digital workforce of intelligent AI agents — that can autonomously handle complex and time-consuming tasks while staying within defined guardrails. With Agentforce for Public Sector, government agencies can use AI agents to assist employees and constituents, speeding up government responsiveness, enabling better support for the public, simplifying enforcement, and reducing risk for government workers. This frees government workers to focus on mission-critical tasks while enabling easier, faster, and more cost-effective public services. H2: Why it Matters Government leaders around the globe recognize AI’s value to help improve efficiency, productivity, job satisfaction, and service delivery, and 64% expect significant cost savings as a result. The public is also ready for AI support in government — in fact, 90% are open to AI-powered government services . Yet, while the value is clear, concerns over issues like data privacy and security have slowed wider adoption. Agentforce for Public Sector addresses these concerns by providing trusted, secure, and certified AI solutions that can be quickly deployed to support government workers and constituents, unlocking the full potential of AI to transform public services. H2: Agentforce in Action in City Hall Early government adopters are already seeing the impact. The City of Kyle, Texas, one of the fastest-growing in the nation, is using Agentforce to transform community engagement and create a centralized, scalable service model. Citizens now benefit from a seamless experience when contacting their local government, with easy access to information and transparent tracking of service requests — from reporting a pothole to inquiring about council meeting outcomes. “Agentforce has greatly enhanced our ability to deliver an exceptional customer experience, work more efficiently, and drive cost containment. It’s like having every aspect of town hall instantly accessible 24/7, whether you’re a city employee or a resident seeking help,” said Jesse Elizondo, Assistant City Manager, City of Kyle, Texas. Agentforce has greatly enhanced our ability to deliver an exceptional customer experience, work more efficiently, and drive cost containment. Jesse Elizondo, Assistant City Manager, City of Kyle, Texas H2: Go Deeper: Trusted Digital Labor Improves Government Responsiveness Available today, Agentforce for Public Sector enables government agencies to build, tailor, and deploy custom and out-of-the-box agents. Now, agencies can use AI agents to autonomously handle work like answering common citizen queries and processing license renewals. And because Agentforce adheres to stringent global compliance requirements , including FedRAMP High, Protected-B, and IRAP, government leaders can trust they are secure and compliant. With Agentforce for Public Sector, agencies can now also take advantage of prebuilt actions (which tasks an agent can perform) like ‘find similar complaints’ or ‘check for regulatory code violations’ specifically designed for the public sector. These actions can be quickly deployed and adapted for every employee, department, and organizational process, saving development time, increasing efficiency, and improving productivity for government workers. New actions available today include: Simplify enforcement and reduce risk : Based on relevant regulations, an AI agent can support compliance officers and inspectors by recommending specific code violations, helping with regulatory fee calculations, and creating documentation. From flagging violations to generating follow-up emails, agents with Compliance Management actions help cut down on administrative work. Speed up response and spot trends : Agencies can use digital labor to summarize and analyze constituent complaints, identify related past issues and recommend next steps based on relevant policies and regulations. By grouping similar complaints and flagging frequent pain points, agents with Complaint Management actions can resolve issues faster and surface valuable insights to guide policy and service improvements. Find and hire top talent, faster : Agencies can speed up hiring and reduce recruiting administrative burdens with AI-powered resume matching and candidate engagement. With Recruitment Management actions, recruiters can tap agents to help them understand qualifications at a glance, share candidates with hiring managers, and email applicants automatically to speed up hiring decisions and improve the applicant experience. Recommend a job position to an applicant : Helps job seekers discover the most relevant job opportunities based on their skills, experience, and goals. By recommending job postings that best match their profile, the agent can increase application conversion rates and reduce time spent searching for jobs. Help constituents apply for benefits : Enables constituents to converse naturally with an agent, in all supported languages, to ask about applicable benefits and eligibility criteria. This helps constituents receive the assistance they need in a timely manner, while also enabling faster application processing, reduced error rates, and increased policy compliance. Simplify complaints management for constituents : Helps complainants and employees easily find accurate information about policies and compliance requirements, and then guides them in filing their complaint. This enables them to follow applicable regulations, which expedites the review process and helps to reduce resolution times. “The future of government is intelligent, efficient, proactive, and deeply connected to the needs of its constituents. Agentforce for Public Sector makes this future possible by integrating trusted, secure AI into the fabric of government operations. With AI agents working alongside dedicated government workers and providing 24/7 support for constituents – helping with everything from routine inquiries to complex, time consuming tasks – Agentforce will power a more responsive, agile, and effective government.” – Nasi Jazayeri, EVP & GM of Public Sector at Salesforce H2: How a Texas Boomtown Used AI to Reinvent City Government. GO DEEPER H2: How it Works Built on Salesforce’s Public Sector Solutions , Agentforce for Public Sector allows agencies to deploy AI agents in weeks, not months, and enables non-technical teams to easily tailor agents with plain language and pre-built templates. And, because it leverages the Public Sector Solutions data model and integrates with Data Cloud , it pulls insights from multiple applications and data sources, so decisions are accurate and grounded in a complete picture. The Atlas Reasoning Engine — the “brain” behind Agentforce — can process and analyze complex data from multiple sources to make informed decisions, provide predictive insights, and generate actionable recommendations. The Atlas Reasoning Engine uses advanced techniques like ensemble retrieval augmented generation (RAG), which combines the strengths of several RAG models, to find highly specific, accurate data for agents. Data Cloud is the connective tissue for the Salesforce Platform, making it easy to incorporate structured and unstructured data from different sources inside or outside Salesforce, like apps, data lakes, emails, images, PDFs, or legacy systems. Salesforce’s unique Trust Layer protects privacy and security with features like dynamic grounding, zero data retention, and toxicity detection, helping to enable responsible AI use and maintain high safety and security standards. And because of Salesforce’s deeply unified platform , public sector organizations can take advantage of innovation happening across the Salesforce ecosystem. This includes using Agent Builder to easily tailor an out-of-the-box agent for specific government use cases by defining topics, which include natural-language instructions and additional guardrails. To customize it further, public sector teams can easily connect a library of actions from existing business logic built in Salesforce, such as Flows, Apex, MuleSoft APIs , and prompt templates. H2: Salesforce Partner Ecosystem Strengthens Agentforce for Public Sector Agentforce for Public Sector runs securely on AWS to help enable regulatory compliance and data residency requirements . Agentforce for Public Sector is also now available to government customers through the AWS Marketplace. And, public sector leaders can accelerate implementation and ROI by working with trusted Salesforce partners like IBM Consulting. “Agents represent a fundamental shift in how organizations operate, enabling unprecedented levels of productivity and innovation across every industry,” said Amy Belcher, Director, WWPS ISV Sales, AWS. “Our infrastructure is built to meet the most stringent security requirements of high-sensitivity organizations worldwide, and we continue to help partners like Salesforce achieve FedRAMP accreditations and leverage AWS Marketplace to help government agencies solve real needs, accelerate innovation and time-to-value.” “Agentforce for Public Sector will help drive unprecedented efficiency across many facets of the public sector,” said Susan Wedge, Managing Partner, U.S. Federal Market, IBM Consulting . “Highly-tuned agents have the potential to transform how every constituent is served. IBM Consulting’s Salesforce practice guides public sector organizations on their AI transformations, helping them scale the adoption of agents. Agentforce Public Sector is complemented by IBM watsonx, allowing an open approach to agentic AI.” Related Availability: Agentforce for Public Sector is available now.
