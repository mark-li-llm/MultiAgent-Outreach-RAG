Too often, though, that information is stored and processed in disparate systems that don’t easily communicate with one another. The stakes are enormous for life sciences organizations, in both financial and human terms. Getting new drugs and devices from research and development through regulatory approvals, for example, can take nearly a decade and cost almost a billion dollars . And even once an intervention is commercially available, actually employing the real-world evidence on these innovative medicines is an arduous task. With artificial intelligence (AI), life sciences organizations can cut through the noise and simplify engagement with healthcare organizations, allowing them to spend more time with their patients. That’s why a growing number of the world’s leading pharmaceutical, medical technology, and contract research organizations (CROs) have purchased Salesforce’s Agentforce-enabled Life Sciences Cloud to integrate sales, service, marketing, and clinical data on one, end-to-end deeply unified Platform to help ensure that healthcare professionals (HCPs) and their patients get the right information at the right time, ultimately improving access to therapies. H2: Salesforce Engages with Takeda to Bring Cutting Edge AI-Powered Customer Experience Platform to Life Science Industry LEARN MORE More than 70 industry leaders — including Fresenius Kabi , Pfizer , and Takeda — have entrusted Life Sciences Cloud as their intelligent solution to connect clinical, commercial, and patient care operations. Now, clinical trial sites and sponsors can use AI to recruit the optimal, diverse group of candidates or trial location or identify the best location for a study, field sales reps can do things like make the most of their interactions with HCPs by using assistants to prep for visits and follow-up, and patient services teams can use agents to automate coverage analysis, proactive alerts, and bulk verifications and leverage insights to help improve medication adherence. “The life sciences industry has been in need of a single, trusted platform that connects all engagement points with providers to create a better and more personalized experience,” said Frank Defesche, GM and SVP of Salesforce Life Sciences. “We’re thrilled to work with the world’s top organizations to power compliant, unified patient and HCP experiences across clinical, medical, point-of-care, and commercial engagement.” The life sciences industry has been in need of a single, trusted platform that connects all engagement points with providers to create a better and more personalized experience.
