In today’s constantly evolving AI landscape, innovations like autonomous agents are emerging so quickly that businesses struggle to keep pace. This expanded partnership provides crucial flexibility, empowering customers to develop tailored AI solutions that meet their specific needs, rather than being locked into a single model provider. Google Cloud is at the forefront of enterprise AI innovation with millions of developers building with Google’s cutting-edge Gemini models and on Google Cloud’s AI-optimized infrastructure. This expanded partnership will empower Salesforce customers to build Agentforce agents using Gemini and to deploy Salesforce on Google Cloud. This is an expansion of the existing partnership that allows customers to use data bi-directionally from Google BigQuery, and Salesforce via zero copy technology — further equipping customers with the data, AI, trust, and actions they need to bring autonomous agents into their businesses. “Through our expanded partnership with Google Cloud and deep integrations at the platform, application, and infrastructure layer, we’re giving customers choice in the applications and models they want to use,” said Srini Tallapragada, Salesforce President & Chief Engineering and Customer Success Officer. “Salesforce offers a complete enterprise-grade agentic AI platform that makes it easy to deploy new capabilities easily and realize business value fast. Google Cloud is a pioneer in enterprise agentic AI, offering some of the most powerful, capable models, agents, and AI development tools on the planet. Together we are creating the best place for businesses to scale with digital labor .” Together we are creating the best place for businesses to scale with digital labor . Srini Tallapragada, Salesforce President & Chief Engineering and Customer Success Officer “Salesforce’s selection of Google Cloud as a major infrastructure provider means enterprise customers can now deploy some of their most critical applications on our highly secure, AI-optimized infrastructure — with minimal friction,” said Thomas Kurian, CEO of Google Cloud. “Our mutual customers have asked us to be able to work more seamlessly across Salesforce and Google Cloud, and this expanded partnership will help them accelerate their AI transformations with agentic AI, state-of-the-art AI models, data analytics, and more.” “At Wayfair, we’re deeply committed to using data and AI to create exceptional customer experiences,” said Fiona Tan, CTO of Wayfair. “The Salesforce and Google Cloud partnership, particularly the availability of Salesforce on Google Cloud infrastructure and the integration of Agentforce and Gemini, offers powerful new capabilities to personalize interactions and empower our teams to better serve our customers.” H2: Why it matters: Agentic AI isn’t just emerging; it’s already here and represents a $2 trillion market opportunity , according to a study from Salesforce. In fact, 84% of CIOs believe AI will be as significant to businesses as the internet .

In fact, 84% of CIOs believe AI will be as significant to businesses as the internet . To fully realize this potential, businesses need an agentic strategy with openness, trust, and choice at the center. This includes: Data: Highly secure and unified access to all your data, no matter where it resides, with a zero-copy architecture and enriched metadata for deeper insights. This breaks down data silos across platforms so customers don’t have to sacrifice choice for an integrated experience, unlike solutions that hoard data access or require users to cobble together disparate solutions. AI: Unparalleled choice and flexibility with leading AI models, including predictive, generative, and multi-modal options. This allows businesses to tailor solutions to their specific needs and avoid being locked into a single provider’s AI capabilities. Trust: A multi-layered approach to protect your data and infrastructure with encryption, data residency options, and a choice of infrastructure providers. Additionally, robust guardrails, bias detection, explainability, and toxicity controls are built-in to ensure responsible AI development and deployment. Actions: Seamless integration of automation, analytics, and applications across platforms to streamline workflows and drive efficiency across the organization. This allows businesses to maximize the impact of AI agents by connecting them to their existing tools and systems, unlike solutions with limited integrations or closed ecosystems. H2: How Businesses Win By Moving Beyond the Hype with a Deeply Unified Platform. READ THE STORY H2: Data: Real-time responses in Agentforce with Google Search Agentforce will be able to use Grounding with Google Search through Vertex AI, building on the secure data foundation established through the zero copy partnership between Salesforce Data Cloud and Google BigQuery. This integration empowers Agentforce agents with the ability to reference up-to-the-minute data, news, current events, and credible citations, substantially enhancing their contextual awareness and ability to deliver accurate, evidence-backed responses. For example, in supply chain management and logistics, an agent built with Agentforce could track shipments and monitor inventory levels in Salesforce Commerce Cloud , and proactively identify potential disruptions using real-time data from Google Search, including weather conditions, port congestion, and geopolitical events. Availability is expected in the coming months. H2: AI: Unlocking the power of choice and flexibility with Gemini and Agentforce Businesses need the freedom to choose the best models for their needs rather than be locked into one vendor. In 2025, Google’s Gemini models will also be available for prompt building and reasoning directly within Agentforce. With Gemini and Agentforce, businesses will benefit from: Agents with multi-modal capabilities: Gemini’s native multimodality lets agents “see” and interpret the world, enabling AI to recognize images (like error codes) and detect emotions in voice. Integrating this into Agentforce creates smarter agents that respond to audio, video, and text. Expanded contextual understanding and reasoning: Gemini’s 2 million-token context window lets agents retain and reference massive amounts of information, like entire codebases, years of customer interactions, or product documentation. Increased speed and efficiency: Google’s Tensor processing Units (TPUs), combined with advanced techniques like those used in Google’s NotebookLM , enable Gemini to process and understand information with exceptional speed and efficiency, delivering real-time responses even for complex queries. This translates to faster response times and reduced operational costs. For example, an insurance customer can submit a claim with photos of the damage and an audio voicemail from a witness. Agentforce, using Gemini, can then help the insurance provider deliver better customer experiences by processing all these inputs, assessing the claim’s validity, and even using text-to-speech to cont", "word_count": 670, "token_count": 819, "start_char": 3781, "end_char": 8228, "local_heads": [], "metadata_snapshot": {"company": "Salesforce", "doctype": "press", "date": "2025-02-24", "url": "https://www.salesforce.com/news/press-releases/2025/02/24/google-partnership-expansion-gemini-agentforce/?bc=OTH", "title": "Salesforce and Google Bring Gemini to Agentforce, Enable More Customer Choice in Major Partnership Expansion", "topic": "Agentforce|Data Cloud|Partnership|Executive|Security|GenAI|Industry Solutions|Platform|AI", "persona_tags": ["cio", "vp_customer_experience", "vp_sales_ops"]}}
