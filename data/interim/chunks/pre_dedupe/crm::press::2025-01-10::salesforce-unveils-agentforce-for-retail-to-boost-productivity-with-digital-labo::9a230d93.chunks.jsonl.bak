Marketing Skills for Loyalty Promotion Creation assist marketers in creating and revising loyalty promotions with conversational prompts grounded in shopper, POS, and segmentation data resulting in more personalized email content and subject lines that increase customer engagement. Salesforce is also introducing Retail Cloud with Modern POS , which arms retailers with a user-friendly, cloud-based POS. This system brings online and offline shopping and inventory data together on a single platform, giving associates a single tool to serve their shoppers better and faster. Features include: Clienteling, Inventory Management, Endless Aisle, and built-in AI powered by real-time shopper and inventory data: Associates can create and modify shopper profiles that capture shopping history, preferences, and loyalty status; view and update inventory across warehouses, commerce channels, and supply chain; action on analytics from omni-channel customer, order, inventory, and sales performance data; and activate AI for voice assistance, return fraud analysis, and personalized product recommendations. Mixed Cart and Omni-channel Fulfillment give shoppers more delivery and exchange options while reducing supply chain costs: An omni-cart architecture allows each line item to have its own fulfillment method, offering a single “mixed cart” with shopper fulfillment preferences including buy-online-pickup-in-store (BOPIS), buy-online-return-in-store, and omni exchange. Mobile-first design and secure offline mode release associates from the checkout counter: Offline-capable software enables checkouts anywhere shoppers are ready. Payment transactions are encrypted and stored, ready to be processed when an associate reconnects, allowing sales to occur during a loss of internet, remote and outdoor activity, or peak shopping activity. Built-in Salesforce integrations and no-code CMS get retailers up and running quickly: Integrations with Salesforce Commerce Cloud , Order Management , and Service Cloud let retailers quickly access customer data insights, order management, cart synchronization, product information management, and more. The cloud-based CMS uses intuitive drag-and-drop features to tailor the interface to each store’s unique brand. H2: Introducing Retail Cloud with Modern POS. GO DEEPER H2: Retail Cloud + Agentforce increase workforce productivity across front- and back-office teams: AI agents perform best when grounded in accurate, up-to-date customer and operational data. To unlock this value, retailers require solutions that can unify, action, and scale data from both online and offline shopping activity. With Salesforce’s Modern POS and Data Cloud , retailers can harmonize data and metadata from in-store, commerce, marketing, service, and loyalty systems to give employees and associates a unified, near real-time view of activity across the entire shopper journey. Retailers can now use Agentforce, with enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), to retrieve and take action on this data and deliver precise answers, tailored engagements, and upsell opportunities with every shopper interaction. Why it matters: In a Salesforce study, 81% of retail executives say that inefficient processes and technology drain associate productivity. Store associates alone log in to more than 16 different applications and systems each day, leaving nearly 78% of store associates without a single, actionable view of their shoppers — resulting in lost productivity and fragmented shopping experiences. The Salesforce perspective: “Together, AI-fueled digital labor and a modern POS can unlock a new scale of operational capacity for retailers. With these latest Agentforce skills for retail and a cloud-based, intuitive POS system, Salesforce is helping retailers deliver seamless, unified shopping experiences across both the physical and digital realms of retail that drive productivity advancements and business growth across their entire enterprise.” – Nitin Mangtani, SVP & GM, Retail, Salesforce Together, AI-fueled digital labor and a modern POS can unlock a new scale of operational capacity for retailers.
